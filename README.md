# Jquery Form Validator Plugin
Form Validator Plugin using Jquery

I faced lot of difficulties with all the plugins which is avalilable on net finally i decided to create my own validator plugin in a simple manner. So i did with the help of Jquery.

This Plugin will give the constand message for the input['required'] field which is in the 'form' with 'novalidate'.Example.

<form role="form" novalidate>

/.... user code.../

</form>

Each field should contain 
<div class="valid-block"></div>
This div, which is used to show the error messages if the field is having error.

If any one of the Form field is having error the submit button of the form will get disable.
